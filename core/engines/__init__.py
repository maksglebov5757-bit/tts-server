# FILE: core/engines/__init__.py
# VERSION: 1.4.0
# START_MODULE_CONTRACT
#   PURPOSE: Re-export the public engine contract, typed configuration, production engine implementations, scheduler surface, registry/discovery surfaces, and the temporary legacy compatibility bridge.
#   SCOPE: barrel re-exports for engine DTOs, TTSEngine, discriminated engine config models, production engines, scheduler helpers, registry loader helpers, and temporary bridge helpers
#   DEPENDS: M-ENGINE-CONTRACTS, M-ENGINE-CONFIG, M-ENGINE-SCHEDULER, M-ENGINE-REGISTRY, M-ENGINE-BRIDGE, M-BACKENDS
#   LINKS: M-ENGINE-CONTRACTS, M-ENGINE-CONFIG, M-ENGINE-SCHEDULER, M-ENGINE-REGISTRY, M-ENGINE-BRIDGE, M-BACKENDS
#   ROLE: BARREL
#   MAP_MODE: SUMMARY
# END_MODULE_CONTRACT
#
# START_MODULE_MAP
#   Contract surface - Re-export TTSEngine, model/audio/job DTOs, and availability/capability types.
#   Config surface - Re-export discriminated engine config models, parsing helpers, and collection settings.
#   Production engine surface - Re-export the first real Piper ONNX engine implementation.
#   Scheduler surface - Re-export the worker-pool key/policy DTOs, scheduler facade, and shutdown error.
#   Registry surface - Re-export EngineRegistry, its typed error, and the loader/entry-point helpers.
#   Compatibility surface - Re-export the temporary legacy compatibility bridge and registry builder.
# END_MODULE_MAP

# START_CHANGE_SUMMARY
#   LAST_CHANGE: [v1.4.0 - Task 11: re-exported the standalone engine scheduler surface for later runtime integration while preserving existing TTSService wiring]
# END_CHANGE_SUMMARY
