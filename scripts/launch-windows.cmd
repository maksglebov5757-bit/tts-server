REM FILE: scripts/launch-windows.cmd
REM VERSION: 1.0.0
REM START_MODULE_CONTRACT
REM   PURPOSE: Provide a Windows CMD launcher entrypoint that bypasses PowerShell script-signing policy by running the existing PowerShell orchestrator as an inline command.
REM   SCOPE: Windows-only bootstrap, project-root resolution, PowerShell availability checks, and delegation into scripts/launch-windows.ps1 through a signed-file-independent command string.
REM   DEPENDS: M-WINDOWS-LAUNCHER
REM   LINKS: M-WINDOWS-LAUNCHER-CMD
REM   ROLE: SCRIPT
REM   MAP_MODE: LOCALS
REM END_MODULE_CONTRACT

REM START_MODULE_MAP
REM   SCRIPT_DIR - Directory containing this CMD wrapper.
REM   PROJECT_ROOT - Repository root resolved relative to the wrapper location.
REM   PS_SCRIPT - Canonical interactive PowerShell launcher path.
REM END_MODULE_MAP
REM
REM START_CHANGE_SUMMARY
REM   LAST_CHANGE: [v1.0.0 - Added a CMD wrapper that launches the existing PowerShell orchestration through -Command so Windows hosts with MachinePolicy AllSigned still have a supported interactive entrypoint]
