# Support Matrix

## Evidence levels

- **Proven** — validated by local execution in this repository session and/or CI workflow evidence
- **Partially proven** — validated architecturally and by targeted tests, but not fully exercised end-to-end on that platform/backend combination in this session
- **Best effort** — intended to work, guarded by tests or host checks, but external runtime dependencies may vary by host
- **Unsupported** — not declared as a supported operator path

## Platform × backend × family

| Platform | Backend | Model family | Evidence level | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | MLX | Qwen3-TTS | Proven | Primary optimized path; local regression and live runtime validation exist |
| macOS Apple Silicon | ONNX | Piper | Proven | Local Piper voice synthesis validated through `piper-tts` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | Torch | Qwen3-TTS | Partially proven | Supported by code and tests, but MLX remains the preferred path |
| macOS Apple Silicon | Qwen Fast | Qwen3-TTS custom-only | Unsupported | Fast lane is CUDA-oriented and reports explicit rejection/fallback diagnostics on macOS |
| Linux | Torch | Qwen3-TTS | Partially proven | Official upstream install path exists via `pip install -U qwen-tts`; full host validation still remains outstanding |
| Linux | Qwen Fast | Qwen3-TTS custom-only | Partially proven | Additive accelerated lane exists in code/tests with explicit CUDA/runtime gating and fallback to Torch; end-to-end host evidence still depends on CUDA-capable validation |
| Linux | ONNX | Piper | Partially proven | Supported by code and CI-oriented setup guidance |
| Windows | Torch | Qwen3-TTS | Best effort | Official upstream install path exists via `pip install -U qwen-tts`, but Windows runtime validation in this repo remains best effort |
| Windows | Qwen Fast | Qwen3-TTS custom-only | Best effort | CUDA-oriented fast lane is wired with explicit diagnostics and Torch fallback, but Windows runtime validation remains best effort |
| Windows | ONNX | Piper | Best effort | Covered by best-effort CI self-check path; external runtime compatibility should be verified per deployment |
| Any platform | MLX | Piper | Unsupported | Piper routes through ONNX, not MLX |
| Any platform | ONNX | Qwen3-TTS | Unsupported | Qwen3 runtime is not wired to ONNX in this repository |

## Operator interpretation

- The **selected backend** can differ from the **execution backend** for a specific model.
- Mixed-family deployments are expected to report per-model routing explicitly.
- `qwen_fast` is a **custom-only** Qwen lane in the current MVP and must not be read as clone/design acceleration.
- When fast prerequisites are missing, operators should expect explicit route candidates and fallback reasons rather than silent disablement.
- The accelerated runtime itself is operator-managed: use `pip install faster-qwen3-tts` on supported Linux/Windows CUDA hosts and keep the standard Torch lane available as fallback.
- Platform claims should be read together with CI status and runtime self-check output.
- `grace` CLI is optional and currently documented upstream through the GRACE packaging repository as `bun add -g @osovv/grace-cli`.

## Canonical evidence commands

```bash
python scripts/runtime_self_check.py
python -m pytest -m "unit or integration"
python scripts/validate_runtime.py host-matrix
QWEN_TTS_QWEN_FAST_TEST_MODE=eligible python scripts/runtime_self_check.py
QWEN_TTS_QWEN_FAST_TEST_MODE=cuda_missing python scripts/runtime_self_check.py
python scripts/validate_runtime.py smoke-server
python scripts/validate_runtime.py telegram-live --bot-token "$QWEN_TTS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
python scripts/validate_runtime.py telegram-live --bot-token "$QWEN_TTS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" --chat-id "$QWEN_TTS_TELEGRAM_VALIDATION_CHAT_ID" --expect-update-chat-id "$QWEN_TTS_TELEGRAM_VALIDATION_CHAT_ID" --expect-update-text "Qwen3-TTS validation ping."
```

## Automation notes

- `python scripts/validate_runtime.py host-matrix` runs the baseline runtime self-check plus simulated `qwen_fast` readiness scenarios (`eligible`, `cuda_missing`, `dependency_missing`) so optional-lane support claims stay tied to real routing evidence.
- `python scripts/validate_runtime.py smoke-server` starts a temporary local HTTP server, waits for `/health/live` and `/health/ready`, runs the smoke pytest module, and stops the server automatically.
- `python scripts/validate_runtime.py telegram-live --bot-token "$QWEN_TTS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"` validates real Telegram Bot API reachability without entering the long-polling loop. Add `--chat-id <id>` if you also want an automated `sendMessage` check.
- Add `--expect-update-chat-id <id>` and optionally `--expect-update-text <substring>` for an opt-in dedicated validation chat where the script also confirms that a matching newer inbound update becomes visible through `getUpdates`.
