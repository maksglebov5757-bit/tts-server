# FILE: tests/unit/core/test_model_families.py
# VERSION: 1.0.0
# START_MODULE_CONTRACT
#   PURPOSE: Unit tests for non-Qwen model family adapters added to the planner/runtime pipeline.
#   SCOPE: OmniVoice family capability matching and execution payload preparation
#   DEPENDS: M-MODEL-FAMILY, M-EXECUTION-PLAN
#   LINKS: V-M-MODEL-FAMILY
#   ROLE: TEST
#   MAP_MODE: LOCALS
# END_MODULE_CONTRACT
#
# START_MODULE_MAP
#   build_plan - Helper that assembles execution plans for family adapter tests
#   test_omnivoice_family_adapter_prepares_voice_design_execution - Verifies OmniVoice design payload preparation
# END_MODULE_MAP
#
# START_CHANGE_SUMMARY
#   LAST_CHANGE: [v1.1.1 - Focused family adapter coverage on the supported OmniVoice surface]
# END_CHANGE_SUMMARY
